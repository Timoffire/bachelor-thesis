Why: By increasing the value of inventory beyond its actual cost, the company can reduce net income and the taxes it has to pay that year.","Verdict: Against
Why: Overvaluing inventory increases cost of goods sold and reduces gross profit, leading to higher taxes."
gemma:7b,"According to the valuation method based on tax shields, the value of the company (Vl) is the value of the unleveraged company (Vu) plus the value of tax shields (VTS). Therefore, the higher the interest, the higher the VTS. So, does the value of the company increase if I call my bank and tell them to charge me double the interest?","Verdict: Against
Why: Increased interest expense would lead to a higher value of tax shields (VTS), but also a higher cost of capital, offsetting the benefit of the tax shield.","Verdict: Against
Why: Increased interest reduces the value of tax shields, thereby lowering the company's value."
gemma:7b,I cannot seem to start a valuation. In order to calculate E + D = VA (FCF; WACC) I need the WACC and in order to calculate the WACC I need D and E. Where should I start?,"Verdict: Start with calculating E (Earnings) from the financial statements.

Reasoning: The question requires the calculation of WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital) to determine the value of the firm (VA). However, the calculation of WACC necessitates the knowledge of both debt (D) and equity (E) values. Since E is already required for the valuation, it makes sense to start by calculating E from the financial statements before proceeding with the WACC calculation and subsequent valuation.","Verdict: Start with estimating D and E.
Why: These are the components of the capital structure that are needed to calculate the WACC, which is required to perform the valuation."
gemma:7b,Does the book value of the debt always coincide with its market value?,"Verdict: Against
Why: The paper notes that book values of debt are typically close to market value, but suggests that marking financial assets could be biased.","Verdict: Against
Why: Book value ignores market conditions and changes in interest rates, leading to discrepancies between the recorded value and market value of debt."
gemma:7b,Is the Free Cash Flow (FCF) the sum of the equity cash flow and the debt cash flow?,"Verdict: Against
Why: FCF excludes cash flows related to debt, focusing only on cash flows generated from operating activities.","Verdict: Against

Why: The provided text does not define Working Capital Requirements, so the given assumption is inaccurate.","Verdict: Against
Why: Working Capital Requirements considers the operating cycle, factoring in inventory and accounts receivable/payable turnover."
gemma:7b,"Why can we not calculate the required return (Ke) from the Gordon-Shapiro model [P = Div (1+g) / (Ke - g)] instead of using the CAPM? As we know the current 0 0 dividend (Div ) and the current share price (P ), we can obtain the growth rate of the 0 0 dividend from the formula g = ROE (1-p)/(1 - ROE (1-p)), p being the payout.","Verdict: Against
Why: The Gordon-Shapiro model uses a constant growth rate of dividends, which may not be appropriate for all companies, as it does not capture the transitory elements in earnings and ROE.","Verdict: Against
Why: The Gordon-Shapiro model is not suitable for calculating the required return as it assumes constant dividends, which contradicts the given information of a current dividend of 0."
gemma:7b,Assume I calculate g as ROE (1-p)/(1-ROE (1-p)) and the Ke from the CAPM. I replace both values in the formula PER = (ROE (1+g) - g)/ROE (Ke-g) but the PER I obtain is totally different from the one I get by dividing the quotation of the share to the earnings per share. Is it possible to interpret that difference as an overvaluation or undervaluation of that share on the market?,"Verdict: Against
Reasoning: The formula provided likely suffers from theoretical inconsistencies and may not accurately reflect the market value of the share based on the given assumptions.","Verdict: Against
Why: The PER formula may not accurately reflect market valuation due to limitations of the CAPM model or deviations from efficient markets."
gemma:7b,I was assigned a valuation of the shares of a pharmaceutical laboratory. Which valuation method is more convenient?,"Verdict: For market capitalization approach
Why: The market capitalization approach is more convenient as it directly reflects the value of the company based on the price investors are willing to pay for its shares in the open market.","Verdict: For DCF
Why: DCF is widely used for valuing pharmaceutical companies due to their predictable cash flows and long-term earnings potential."
gemma:7b,"I need to know how to value a company well, but I cannot clearly see the valuation process of a company starting from its past income statements. What are the systematical steps I need to take? Firstly, I think I should elaborate the provisional statements for the following fiscal years and then calculate the cash flows, discount them at the present moment (with a discount factor), add the terminal value to it and the difference between the book net value and the market value of intangibles. I really need that these steps be methodical and easy to understand so I can use them as a guide when valuing a company.","**Verdict:** For
**Why:** The steps outlined provide a systematic approach to valuing a company by considering past income statements, adjusting for accounting discrepancies, and estimating future cash flows and terminal value.","Verdict: For

gemma:7b,"A court assigned to me (as an economist and auditor) a valuation of a market butcher’s. The butcher’s did not provide any simple income statements or any valuable information which I could use in my valuation. It is a small business with just two employees, the owner and an apprentice. This type of tax system exempts them of 4 - IESE Business School-University of Navarra certain commercial and fiscal informative statements. I think it is very important to underline that the object of the valuation is not a company, but rather a business, a work position. Although it has recurrent customers the value of its tangible assets is solely the value of its tools, as the premises are rented (I think it is impossible to value the intangible asset that is the work). Obviously, discounting cash flows in not an appropriate method in this case. Actually, I do not know which profession fits better the job that the court assigned to me.","Verdict: Against
Why: Traditional valuation methods like discounting cash flows or using book/market values are not suitable for valuing a small business with limited financial information or intangible assets.","Verdict: Against
Why: Traditional valuation methods are unlikely to be suitable for valuing a small business with limited financial information and primarily consisting of intangible assets."

gemma:7b,Is the following affirmation of an accountancy expert true? “The valuation criterion which reflects the value of the shares of a company in the most accurate manner is based on the amount of the shareholder’s equity of its balance sheet. Stating that the value of a company’s shares equals its book value is a valid argument.”,"Verdict: Against
Why: The book value of equity is not an accurate measure of a company's share value as it does not reflect the value of growth assets or market expectations.","Verdict: Against
Why: Book value only reflects historical costs, ignoring market factors and future prospects."
gemma:7b,Could we say that goodwill is equivalent to brand value?,"Verdict: Against

This aligns with the ICAC definition of share value as the sum of the expected future results of the company during a certain period, discounted at the moment of valuation.","Verdict: For
Why: The definition aligns with the fundamental principle of valuing shares as the present value of future earnings potential."
gemma:7b,Is it true that a company creates value for its shareholders during a year if it distributes dividends or if the quotation of the shares increases?,"Verdict: For
Reasoning: Dividends can signal good company performance and increase investor attractiveness, while a rising share price can indicate increased investor confidence and value.","Verdict: For
Why: Both actions indicate the company is generating excess cash, reflecting value creation for shareholders."
gemma:7b,"The ROE (Return on Equity) is the ratio between net income and Shareholders’ equity. The meaning of ROE is return to shareholders. Consequently, is ROE a correct measurement of the return to shareholders? IESE Business School-University of Navarra - 5","Verdict: Against
Why: ROE only measures the return to equity investors, not the return to all shareholders, as it excludes the return to other stakeholders like creditors.","Verdict: Against
Why: ROE measures net income divided by total equity, not just the return to shareholders as it includes retained earnings."
gemma:7b,"Regarding the WACC that has to be applied to a project, should it be an expected return, an opportunity cost or the average historical return on similar projects?","Verdict: Expected return
Why: The WACC should reflect the specific risk and return characteristics of the project being evaluated, rather than relying on historical returns or opportunity costs.","Verdict: For expected return
Why: WACC should reflect the specific project's risk and cost of capital, rather than historical averages or opportunistic returns."
gemma:7b,"Could we assume that, as we cannot predict the future evolution of the value of shares, a good approximation would be to consider it constant during the next five years?","Verdict: Against
Why: The provided text suggests that historical returns may not be reliable predictors of future returns, implying that assuming constant share value over the next five years may not be accurate.","Verdict: Against
Why: Share prices are volatile and unlikely to remain constant over any significant period."
gemma:7b,"The reasonable thing to do is to finance current assets (collections, inventories…) with short-term debt, and fixed assets with long-term debt. Is this correct?","Verdict: Against
Why: The provided text suggests that the statement is not entirely accurate, as some firms may choose to finance fixed assets with short-term debt or current assets with long-term debt depending on their financial situation and cost of capital.","Verdict: For
Why: Short-term debt aligns with the liquidity of current assets, while long-term debt matches the long-term nature of fixed assets."
gemma:7b,Is the market risk premium a parameter for the national economy or for the world economy?,"Verdict: For the national economy
Why: The text suggests that the market risk premium is primarily influenced by factors specific to the national economy, such as transaction costs and firm-level risk.","Verdict: For the national economy
Why: Market risk premium reflects expectations about future economic conditions specific to a nation, rather than global economic trends."
gemma:7b,The market risk premium is the difference between the historical return on the stock market and the return on bonds. But how many years does “historical” imply? Shall we use the arithmetic mean or the geometric one?,"Verdict: Geometric mean
Why: The text suggests that the historical market risk premium is based on the geometric mean of annual returns over a period of time, rather than the arithmetic mean.","Verdict: Use the geometric mean
Why: The geometric mean better reflects the compounding effect of market returns over time, which is relevant for assessing market risk."
gemma:7b,"We are valuing a company, a lot smaller than ours, in order to buy it. As that company is a lot smaller than ours it will have no influence on the capital structure and on the risk of the resulting company. This is the reason why I believe that the beta and the capital structure which are relevant to the valuation of the company we are analyzing are the ones of our company. Am I right?","Verdict: Against
Why: The size of the company significantly influences its beta and capital structure, which in turn affects its risk and value.","Verdict: Against
Why: The smaller company's capital structure and risk profile are irrelevant to the larger company's valuation due to the insignificant influence on the overall capital structure and risk."
gemma:7b,"Our company (A) is going to buy another company (B). We want to value the shares of B and, therefore, we will use three alternatives of the structure Debt/Shareholders’ Equity so as to obtain the WACC: 1) present structure of A; 2) present structure of B, and 3) structure used by A to finance the acquisition of B’s shares. We will value the company B by applying these three alternatives and then take as a reference the average of the results. Is this correct?","Verdict: For
Why: The WACC should reflect the capital structure of the combined entity after the acquisition, which is the third alternative mentioned. Using the other two alternatives would not account for the change in capital structure and would therefore provide an inaccurate valuation.","Verdict: For
Why: Using multiple financing structures helps mitigate the impact of any single structure on the valuation of B’s shares."
gemma:7b,"When valuing the shares of my company, I calculate the present value of the expected cash flows to shareholders and I add to the result obtained cash holdings and liquid investments. Is that correct?","Verdict: For
Why: The approach correctly incorporates the value of cash holdings and liquid investments into the share valuation by adding them to the present value of expected cash flows to shareholders.","Verdict: For
Why: The approach described aligns with the definition of market value, which includes both the discounted future cash flows and the current cash holdings available to shareholders."
gemma:7b,I think the Free Cash Flow (FCF) can be obtained from the Equity Cash Flow (CFac) by using the relation: FCF = CFac + Interests - ∆D. Is this true?,"Verdict: Against
Why: The provided equation does not accurately reflect the relationship between Equity Cash Flow (CFac), Free Cash Flow (FCF), Interests, and Depreciation Expense (∆D). The correct formula for FCF is FCF = Operating Cash Flow (OCF) - Depreciation Expense (∆D).","Verdict: Against
Why: The relation provided omits depreciation expense, which is a non-cash expense impacting Cash Flow from Operations."
gemma:7b,Is the relation between capitalization and book value of shares a good guide to investments?,"Verdict: Against
Why: The market value of equity includes expectations for future growth, which biases the return on capital computed using market values of debt and equity for growth firms.","Verdict: Against
Why: Market value often differs from book value due to factors like intangible assets and accounting policies."
gemma:7b,Does it make any sense to form a portfolio comprised of companies with a higher return per dividend?,"Verdict: For
Why: The ""dividends-do-count"" theory suggests that increasing dividend payouts reduces the required return on equity, implying that investors may prefer stocks with higher dividend yields.","Verdict: For
Why: Higher dividend yield suggests greater potential for income generation."
gemma:7b,"A financial consultant is valuing the company I set as an objective (an entertainment centre) by discounting the cash flows until the end of the dealership at 7.26% (interest rate on 30-year-bonds = 5.1%; market premium = 5%, and Beta = 0.47%). 0.47 is a beta provided by Bloomberg for Kinepolis (the company whose activity is the management of several cinemas in the EU), in function of the Dax Index. Is it correct to use the beta of Kinepolis in this valuation?","Verdict: Against
Reasoning: The beta provided by Bloomberg for Kinepolis may not be appropriate for the entertainment centre being valued due to different industry risk profiles and market environments.","Verdict: Against
Why: The company in question operates in a different industry (entertainment centre) from Kinepolis (cinemas), making the beta of Kinepolis unlikely to be relevant to the valuation of the entertainment centre."
gemma:7b,"I am confused because I see different formulae to lever and unlever betas in different books (Damodaran, McKinsey, Brealey & Myers …). Which is the correct one? 6 - IESE Business School-University of Navarra","Verdict: Against
Why: Different books use different methodologies to calculate leverage and unlever betas, making it difficult to compare across sources.","Verdict: For Damodaran's formula
Why: It is the most widely used and theoretically sound for most applications."
gemma:7b,An investment bank affirms that the VTS (Value of Tax Shields) of my company is equal to each year’s VTS using the WACC as a discount rate. I told them that I have never seen such a calculation of the VTS but they answered that it was a habitual practice. Is that true?,"Verdict: Against
Why: The provided statement is inaccurate. The VTS should be calculated using the after-tax cost of capital, not the WACC.","Verdict: Against
Why: The VTS should be discounted at a rate reflecting the time value of money, not the WACC, which is an after-tax cost of capital."
gemma:7b,"I have two valuations of the company we set as an objective. In one of them, the present value of tax shields (D Kd T) was calculated using Ku (required return to unlevered equity) and, in the other one, using Kd (required return to debt). The second valuation is a lot higher than the first one, but which of the two is better?","Verdict: Against using Kd
Why: Kd includes the cost of debt capital, which is not relevant for valuing tax shields, which are non-cash expenses.","Verdict: For the first valuation
Why: D Kd T using Ku is more conservative as it considers the cost of unlevered equity, which is typically lower than the cost of debt."
gemma:7b,My investment bank told me that the beta provided by Bloomberg incorporates the illiquidity risk and the small cap premium because Bloomberg does the so-called Bloomberg adjustment formula. Is that true?,"Verdict: For
Why: Bloomberg's beta adjustment formula accounts for illiquidity risk and the small cap premium by incorporating additional factors into the calculation beyond just market volatility.","Verdict: For
Why: The Bloomberg adjustment formula explicitly adds liquidity risk and small cap premium components to the traditional beta calculation."
gemma:7b,"As my company is not listed, the investment banks apply an illiquidity premium. Actually, they say it is an illiquidity premium but then they call it a small cap premium. One of the banks, apparently based on Titman y Martin (2007), added the following small cap premiums: “0.91% if the capitalization is situated between $1,167 and $4,794 million; 1.70% if the capitalization is between $331 and $1,167 million; 4.01% if it is lower than $331 million”. Another bank adds 2% because historically the return of small companies was smaller than that of big companies. Which one is more appropriate?","Verdict: Against
Why: The bank's illiquidity premium seems overly simplistic and does not account for the varying liquidity constraints faced by small companies across the size spectrum.","Verdict: For the first bank's approach
Why: The first bank's premium adjustments are more nuanced and align with the capitalisation size of the company, which is more relevant for illiquidity."
gemma:7b,Which taxes do I have to use when calculating the Free Cash Flow (FCF) - is it the marginal tax rate or the medium tax rate of the leveraged company?,"Verdict: Marginal tax rate
Why: FCF is calculated using the marginal tax rate, which is the top statutory federal tax rate plus 2% average state tax rate.","Verdict: For marginal tax rate
Why: Marginal tax rate reflects the tax impact of additional earnings on FCF, which aligns with the definition of FCF as operating income after taxes."
gemma:7b,"According to what I read in a book, market efficiency hypothesis implies that the expected average value of variations in the shares price is zero. Therefore, the best estimate of the future price of a share is its price today, as it incorporates all the available information. Is that right?","Verdict: Against
Why: Market efficiency implies that all available information is reflected in the current share price, negating the possibility of predicting future price movements.","Verdict: Against
Why: Market efficiency implies only that past information is reflected in current price, not future expectations."
gemma:7b,"An investment bank calculated my WACC. The report says: “the definition of the β β WACC is WACC = R + u (R - R ); R being the risk-free rate, u the unleveraged F M F F beta and R the market risk rate.” This is different from what we have seen in our M class. Are they right?","Verdict: Against
Why: The formula provided by the investment bank deviates from the standard WACC formula that includes the levered beta (β) instead of the unleveraged beta (u).","Verdict: Against
Why: The formula provided includes an additional term (u (R - R )) which is not typically included in the standard WACC formula."
gemma:7b,"I read in a sentence passed by the Supreme Court that, in order to value companies, economic doctrine relies on intermediary methods between the practical models and the ‘Anglo-Saxon’ theoretical models common in the United States and United Kingdom, and the criteria set by the Administration is the result of a combination of both methods. This is completely different from what we have seen in class - is it correct?","Verdict: Against
Why: The text suggests that the valuation methods used in practice often deviate from both traditional theoretical models and administrative criteria.","Verdict: For
Why: The statement accurately describes the approach used by economic doctrine to value companies, which involves employing intermediary methods between theoretical and practical models."
gemma:7b,"Did you see the Vueling case? How is it possible that an investment bank set the objective price of its shares in €2.50 per share on the 2nd of October of 2007, just after placing Vueling shares at €31 per share in June 2007?","Verdict: Against
Why: The investment bank significantly overvalued the shares at €31 per share in June 2007, yet set the objective price at €2.50 per share just two months later, indicating a significant downward revision in the company's value.","Verdict: Against
Why: The investment bank significantly undervalued the shares at €2.50 when compared to the June 2007 placement price of €31."
gemma:7b,"I suppose that a valuation consciously realized in my name tells me how much I have to offer for the company, right?","Verdict: Against
Why: The valuation provided is likely based on market expectations and not on the actual value the owner is willing to pay.","Verdict: Against
Why: Market valuation reflects the price investors are willing to pay, not what a single shareholder can afford."
gemma:7b,Do expected equity flows coincide with expected dividends?,"Verdict: For
Why: The evidence suggests that investors like high dividend-payouts, indicating that expected equity flows and expected dividends are likely to coincide.","Verdict: For
Why: Dividends are a primary component of expected equity flows, ensuring alignment between the two."
gemma:7b,What is the difference between simple return and weighted return to shareholders?,"Verdict: For simple return
Why: Weighted return gives more weight to recent years of earnings, while simple return assigns equal weight to all years of earnings.","Verdict: For
Why: Weighted return accounts for the proportion of ownership in each asset, while simple return ignores the ownership distribution."
gemma:7b,Is there any indisputable model to value the brand of a company? IESE Business School-University of Navarra - 7,"Verdict: Against
Why: The provided text suggests that valuing brand name is challenging due to the difficulty in estimating its market or fair value, and that fair value accounting can potentially lead to inaccurate return computations.","Verdict: Against
Why: Brand value is inherently subjective and difficult to quantify due to its intangible nature and multiple influencing factors."
