gemma:7b,4,1,Is the net income of a year the money the company made that particular year or is it a number whose significance is quite doubtful?,"**Verdict: Against**

The provided text suggests that the net income of a year represents the money the company made that particular year, as it is calculated using operating income and other expenses and income that occur during the year.","**Verdict: For**

Net income represents the profit earned by a company after deducting all expenses and taxes from revenue during a specific accounting period."
gemma:7b,4,2,Is depreciation the loss of value of fixed assets?,"**Verdict: Against**

Depreciation is an accounting expense that represents the loss of value of fixed assets over time due to usage or passage of time, but it does not necessarily imply a loss of value in the economic sense.","**Verdict: For**

Depreciation is a non-cash expense that represents the allocation of the cost of fixed assets over their useful lives."
gemma:7b,4,3,"The so-called “cash flow” (net income plus depreciation) is a flow of cash, but is it a flow to the shareholders or to the company?","**Verdict: For**

The cash flow (net income plus depreciation) represents cash flows that are not actually paid out to shareholders but are still relevant to the company's financial health.","Verdict: For
Justification: Cash flow from operations includes net income and depreciation, which are both cash outflows from the company."
gemma:7b,4,4,"The dividend is the part of the net income that the company distributes to shareholders. As the dividend represents real money, the net income is also real money. Is that true?","**Verdict: Against**

The provided text suggests that while the dividend itself is real money, the net income is not necessarily real money as it may include retained earnings or other non-cash items.","Verdict: Against.

While the dividend represents actual cash paid out, the net income is adjusted for non-cash expenses and non-operating items before calculating the dividend."
gemma:7b,4,5,"The part of the net income that is not distributed to shareholders goes to reserves (shareholders’ equity). As dividends represent real money, reserves are also real money. Is that true?","**Verdict: Against**

Reserves represent the portion of net income that is not distributed to shareholders and are retained within the company. They represent potential future investment or operational needs, not actual cash.","Verdict: Against.

Reserves represent potential future obligations of the company, not actual cash. Dividends, on the other hand, represent actual cash distributed to shareholders."
gemma:7b,4,6,Does the shareholders’ equity represent the savings a company has accumulated through the years?,"**Verdict: Against**

Shareholders' equity represents the difference between the total value of assets and the total value of liabilities. It does not necessarily represent the savings a company has accumulated through the years.","**Verdict: Against**

Shareholders' equity reflects the residual interest in the assets of a company after deducting liabilities. It does not represent accumulated savings as it includes retained earnings, which represent profits not distributed to shareholders."
gemma:7b,4,7,Is book value the best proxy to the value of the shares?,"**Verdict: Against**

The provided text suggests that book value is not the best proxy to the value of the shares due to the influence of leverage on profitability and the fact that market values are forward-looking and based on future cash flows.","**Verdict: Against**

Book value is often misleading as a proxy for share value due to non-cash items like depreciation and amortization affecting the balance sheet."
gemma:7b,4,8,Is a valuation realized by a prestigious investment bank a scientifically approved result which any investor could use as a reference?,"**Verdict: Against**

The provided text suggests that company valuation is a complex process involving subjective interpretation and intuition, rather than a purely scientific endeavor. It also highlights the lack of consensus among experts in valuing the same company, indicating that the results of valuation by prestigious investment banks may not be universally accepted or reliable.","**Verdict: Against**

Valuation results obtained from prestigious investment banks are often based on subjective factors and market conditions, and may not be reliable or transparent enough to serve as a reliable reference for investors."
gemma:7b,4,9,Is it possible for a company with a positive net income and which does not distribute dividends to find itself in suspension of payments? IESE Business School-University of Navarra,"**Verdict: For**

**Justification:** The provided text explicitly states that some authorities punish an excessive accumulation of earnings, which can lead to suspension of dividend payments.","**Verdict: For**

A company can still face suspension of payments even with a positive net income if it has significant short-term liabilities that exceed its cash and equivalents."
gemma:7b,4,10,Is the price of futures the best estimate of the €/$ exchange rate?,"**Verdict: Against**

The price of futures may not be the best estimate of the €/$ exchange rate due to expectations about future exchange rates. The market's expectation of the future exchange rate can influence the current exchange rate.","Verdict: Against

Futures prices are influenced by speculation and expectations, not necessarily the underlying fundamentals of the exchange rate."
gemma:7b,4,11,How could we obtain an indisputable discount rate? How should we calculate the beta and the risk premium?,"**Verdict: For**

To obtain an indisputable discount rate, we need to adjust the nominal risk-free rate for inflation. This is because inflation erodes the purchasing power of money over time, and thus the risk-free rate should be expressed in real terms to reflect the true cost of capital.

**Calculating the beta:**

The provided text does not contain any information regarding how to calculate the beta of the portfolio, so this question cannot be answered from the given context.

**Calculating the risk premium:**

The risk premium can be calculated as the difference between the market return and the risk-free rate. In the given example, the market return is 13% and the risk-free rate is 2%, so the risk premium would be:

Risk premium = 13% - 2% = 11%","**Verdict: Against**

Obtaining an indisputable discount rate is not feasible as market conditions are constantly changing and there is always some degree of uncertainty in future returns. The use of historical data to estimate beta and risk premium may not accurately reflect future expectations."
gemma:7b,4,12,My company paid an extremely high price for the acquisition of another company; the price was recommended by the valuation of an investment bank. We now have financial problems. Is there any way to make that bank legally responsible for this situation?,"**Verdict: Against**

The provided text does not contain any information regarding holding investment banks legally accountable for acquisition-related financial problems.","Verdict: Against.

Corporate finance principles do not provide any basis for holding an investment bank legally responsible for the financial problems of a company resulting from an acquisition based solely on their valuation recommendation."
gemma:7b,4,13,Does is make any sense to calculate betas against local indexes when a company has a great part of its operations outside this local market? I have two examples: BBVA and Santander.,"**Verdict: Against**

The use of local market indices to estimate beta may not be appropriate when a company has a significant portion of its operations outside the local market. Local indices may not adequately capture the risk and volatility of the company's operations in other jurisdictions. This can lead to biased beta estimates that do not accurately reflect the company's true risk profile.","**Verdict: Against**

Beta calculations are most reliable when the company's operations are concentrated in the market for which the beta is being calculated. When a significant portion of a company's operations are outside the local market, the beta may not accurately reflect the company's systematic risk."
gemma:7b,4,14,Is it possible to make money in the stock market when the quotations are going down? What is credit sale?,"**Verdict: For**

**Justification:** It is possible to make money in the stock market when the quotations are going down through techniques such as short selling or credit sales. Credit sale involves selling a stock that you do not own, borrowing the stock from a broker, and agreeing to repurchase it later at a higher price. If the stock price falls, the difference between the selling price and repurchase price represents a profit.","**Verdict: For**

When stock prices are declining, investors can still generate returns through credit sales. In this technique, an investor sells a stock on margin, borrowing funds from a brokerage firm to purchase the stock. If the stock price declines, the investor can repurchase the stock at a lower price, generating a profit.

**Credit sale:** A transaction where an investor sells a security with an agreement to repurchase it in the future at a specified price."
gemma:7b,4,15,Are there any ways to analyze and value seasonal businesses?,"**Verdict: For**

Seasonal businesses can be analyzed and valued by tracking seasonality patterns and identifying potential cash flow imbalances. Accurate cash flow management is crucial for managing these imbalances and mitigating associated risks.","**Verdict: For**

Seasonal businesses can be analyzed and valued using techniques that account for the inherent cyclicality of their earnings and cash flows. Methods such as discounted cash flow analysis, adjusted operating income multiples, and industry-specific ratios can aid in assessing their financial performance and value."
gemma:7b,4,16,A financial consultant obtains different valuations of my company when it discounts the Free Cash Flow (FCF) as opposed to when it uses the Equity Cash Flow. Is this correct?,"**Verdict: For**

The FCFE model adjusts for non-cash items like depreciation and interest income, resulting in a more accurate representation of the company's underlying cash generation. This difference in valuation between FCF and Equity Cash Flow is expected as the latter includes non-cash items.","**Verdict: Against**

Free Cash Flow (FCF) and Equity Cash Flow are both relevant measures of a company's cash generation, but they capture different aspects of the business. FCF excludes non-operating expenses like depreciation, while Equity Cash Flow includes these expenses. Depending on the industry and business model, using either measure can lead to different valuations."
gemma:7b,4,17,"Which parameter better measures value creation; the EVA (Economic Value Added), the economic profit or the CVA (Cash Value Added)?","**Verdict: The provided text does not contain any information regarding which parameter better measures value creation, so I am unable to answer this question from the given context.**","**Verdict: EVA**

EVA adjusts for non-operating income and capital costs, providing a more accurate measure of value creation by considering only the operating income generated from the use of capital."
gemma:7b,4,18,How could we project exchange rates in order to be able to forecast exchange differences?,"**Verdict: For**

The provided text suggests several methods for projecting exchange rates to forecast exchange differences:

- Use the Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) relation, acknowledging its limitations.
- Utilize long-dated forward prices or an IRP forecast.
- Employ statistical models that combine the effect of various fundamentals.","**Verdict: For**

Exchange rates can be projected using various statistical models, such as ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) or GARCH (Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity), which consider historical exchange rate data and other relevant factors to generate forecasts."
gemma:7b,4,19,Is it possible to use a constant WACC in the valuation of a company with a changing debt?,"**Verdict: Against**

The standard assumption of constant WACC in the future could lead to severe mistakes in the calculation of the firm's value due to the dynamic nature of the debt ratio over time.","**Verdict: Against**

A constant WACC cannot be used in the valuation of a company with a changing debt structure because the weighted average cost of capital would no longer reflect the changing composition of the company's capital."
gemma:7b,4,20,Is it possible to value companies by calculating the present value of the EVA (Economic Value Added)? Which are the necessary hypotheses so that such valuations provide similar results to discounting cash flows?,"**Verdict: For**

**Justification:** Economic Value Added (EVA) is a measure of the value created by a company beyond the cost of capital. By discounting EVA over time, it is possible to estimate the present value of the value created by the company. This approach provides a more holistic measure of company value compared to simply discounting cash flows, as it considers the impact of operational efficiency and risk management on value.","**Verdict: For**

The EVA can be used as a proxy for the firm's value if the following hypotheses are met:
- The firm operates in a competitive market with perfect competition.
- The firm's assets are fully utilized.
- The firm's capital structure is optimal.
- The EVA is calculated using a risk-adjusted discount rate."
gemma:7b,4,21,"At times, companies accuse investors of performing credit sales that they make their quotations fall. Is that true?","**Verdict: Against**

The provided text suggests that companies often manipulate loan terms to their advantage, while borrowers have the freedom to seek alternative lenders. This implies that the accusation of companies manipulating credit sales to influence quotations is not entirely accurate.","Verdict: Against.
Credit sales are transactions where payment is deferred, not immediate. Companies cannot manipulate quotation levels to influence investor behavior in credit sales."
gemma:7b,4,22,Is it possible to use different WACCs in order to discount each year’s flows? In which cases?,"**Verdict: For**

It is possible to use different WACCs in order to discount each year's flows if the cost of equity and/or cost of debt is expected to change over time. This is because the WACC is a weighted average of the cost of debt and the cost of equity, and the weights can change over time as the debt-to-equity ratio changes.","**Verdict: For**

Different WACCs can be used to discount each year's cash flows if the firm's capital structure or cost of capital components change over time. This allows for a more accurate reflection of the cost of capital used in each period."
gemma:7b,4,23,Is it true that very few Spanish mutual funds outperform their benchmark? Isn’t it strange?,"Verdict: Against

The provided text does not contain any information regarding Spanish mutual funds or their performance, so I am unable to answer this question from the given context.","Verdict: For.

Spanish mutual funds generally experience lower returns compared to their benchmarks due to factors such as low market liquidity and regulatory constraints."
gemma:7b,4,24,What is the market risk premium in Spain at the present moment - the number which I have to use in the valuations?,"**Verdict: Against**

The provided text does not contain any information regarding the current market risk premium in Spain, so I am unable to answer this question from the given context.","**Verdict: Against**

Market risk premiums are highly volatile and difficult to predict with certainty. Reliable data on current market risk premiums in Spain is not readily available and may change significantly over time."
gemma:7b,4,25,Is the difference between the market value of the shares (capitalization) and their book value a good measure for the value creation in a company since its foundation?,"**Verdict: Against**

The difference between the market value of shares and their book value only reflects the market's perception of value creation since the company's inception. It does not necessarily represent the actual value creation, as book values are based on historical costs and do not capture market-driven factors such as growth potential and innovation.","**Verdict: Against**

The difference between market value and book value only reflects short-term market sentiment and accounting practices, rather than the true value creation over time."
gemma:7b,4,26,Does the expected value of the sales and of the net income of Spanish companies have anything to do with sustainable growth?,"**Verdict: For**

The provided text suggests that the expected value of sales and net income of Spanish companies is directly related to sustainable growth. The text explicitly states that ""the sustainable growth rate in equity valuation models is the product of the expected return on equity on new investments and the proportion of earnings held back in the firm (retention ratio)"".","**Verdict: For**

Sustainable growth requires consistent profitability and revenue growth over the long term. The expected value of sales and net income can provide insights into the potential for sustained growth by indicating the ability of a company to generate cash flow and reinvest it for future expansion."
gemma:7b,4,27,Is PER a good guide to investments?,"**Verdict: For**

The provided text suggests that PER can be a useful indicator of market sentiment and the potential value of stocks, aiding in investment decisions.","Verdict: Against

PER is not a reliable guide to investments as it does not consider other important factors such as financial health, industry trends, and management quality."
gemma:7b,4,28,Is there an optimal capital structure? What is it and how can it be calculated?,"**Verdict:** For

**Justification:** The work of Modigliani and Miller suggests that there is no optimal capital structure in the sense that the value of the firm is independent of its capital structure. However, the Trade-off theory argues that managers can find an optimal capital structure to maximize returns from the firm's assets.","**Verdict: For**

The optimal capital structure exists as a balance between minimizing the cost of capital and maximizing the value of the firm. It can be calculated using various methods, such as the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)."
gemma:7b,4,29,"Does financial leverage (debt) have any impact on the Free Cash Flow, on the Cash Flow to Shareholders, on the growth of the company and on the value of the shares?","**Verdict: Against**

Financial leverage can negatively impact Free Cash Flow, Cash Flow to Shareholders, company growth, and share value. The context suggests that with perfect capital markets and no taxes or information asymmetry, debt financing has no effect on value, implying that financial leverage does not enhance or diminish firm value.","**Verdict: For**

Financial leverage can impact all of the mentioned metrics. Increased debt can lead to higher interest expense, reducing Free Cash Flow. It can also reduce Cash Flow to Shareholders due to mandatory debt servicing. High leverage can constrain growth by limiting available funds for investment. Additionally, increased financial risk can lead to a decline in share value."
gemma:7b,4,30,Is it true that if a company does not distribute dividends then the cost of its equity is zero?,"**Verdict: Against**

**Justification:** The provided text explicitly states that altering dividends does not affect the cost of equity.","**Verdict: Against**

Equity without dividends has risk and uncertainty, which justifies a non-zero cost of equity."
gemma:7b,4,31,"The National Company responsible for the company where I work has recently published a document stating that the levered beta of the sector of energy transportation is 0.471870073 (yes, 9 decimals). They obtained this number by considering the betas in the sector, ranging between -0.24 and 1.16. What is the point of being so precise with the betas? Does it make any sense to apply the same beta to all the companies in a sector?","**Verdict: Against**

The provided context suggests that the estimated beta for the energy transportation sector is extremely precise, with 9 decimal places. However, such precision is likely unnecessary and may not be meaningful in practice. Betas are often estimates based on limited data or other assumptions, and the actual beta of a company or sector can vary over time and depending on various factors. Applying the same beta to all companies in a sector may not be appropriate, as different companies within the same sector may have different betas due to factors such as industry sub-sectors, business models, or capital structures.","**Verdict: Against**

Precision at that level of decimal places is not meaningful in the context of beta estimation, which is inherently subject to significant estimation error. Additionally, betas can vary significantly even within the same sector due to differences in company size, industry sub-sector, and capital structure."
gemma:7b,4,32,What is the Capital Cash Flow? Is it the same with Free Cash Flow?,"**Verdict: For**

The Capital Cash Flow is not explicitly defined in the provided text, but it can be inferred from the context that it refers to the net cash flows after accounting for net capital expenditures, changes in working capital, and net changes in debt. This definition aligns with the formula for Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) mentioned in the text.","**Verdict: For**

Capital Cash Flow (CCF) includes all cash flows related to capital expenditures, while Free Cash Flow (FCF) excludes non-operating cash flows like capital expenditures."
gemma:7b,4,33,Is there any consensus between the main authors in finance regarding the market risk premium? IESE Business School-University of Navarra - 3,"**Verdict: Against**

The provided text suggests that there is no consensus among the main authors in finance regarding the market risk premium. The authors acknowledge that estimating the market risk premium is challenging due to the difficulty in predicting future market conditions and the limitations of historical data.","**Verdict: Against**

The market risk premium is a contentious issue with diverse perspectives among prominent finance authors. There is no consensus on its exact definition, estimation, or empirical relevance."
gemma:7b,4,34,Does the book value of the debt always coincide with its market value?,"**Verdict: Against**

The provided text suggests that book values are typically close to market value, but they are not always exactly equal.","Verdict: Against

Debt's market value can differ from its book value due to factors such as changes in interest rates, credit risk, and trading costs."
gemma:7b,4,35,Is the Free Cash Flow (FCF) the sum of the equity cash flow and the debt cash flow?,"**Verdict: Against**

The provided text explicitly states that the traditional formulation of the cash flow calculation assumes there are no preferred dividends paid. This implies that the Free Cash Flow (FCF) is not equal to the sum of the equity cash flow and the debt cash flow.","**Verdict: Against**

FCF excludes financing activities, focusing solely on operating cash flow generated from core business operations."
gemma:7b,4,36,Could we say that the value of shares is intangible?,"**Verdict: Against**

The provided text suggests that the value of shares is not purely intangible, as it is influenced by the market value of shares and the value of debt.","**Verdict: For**

Shares represent ownership in a company and are not physical assets. Their value is based on market perception and reflects ownership rights in the company."
gemma:7b,4,37,Is it true that a company creates value for its shareholders during a year if it distributes dividends or if the quotation of the shares increases?,"**Verdict: For**

The provided text suggests that dividend distributions can increase market confidence and firm value, thereby creating value for shareholders. Additionally, an increase in the share price can also indicate value creation for shareholders.","**Verdict: For**

Shareholder value can increase through either regular dividend distributions or an increase in the share price. Both actions signal confidence in the company's financial health and future prospects."
gemma:7b,4,38,"The reasonable thing to do is to finance current assets (collections, inventories…) with short-term debt, and fixed assets with long-term debt. Is this correct?","**Verdict: Against**

The provided text suggests that current assets should be financed with short-term debt, while fixed assets should be financed with long-term debt. However, the text does not explicitly state that this is the only or best approach for financing current assets and fixed assets.","Verdict: For

Current assets are highly liquid and short-term in nature, making short-term debt an appropriate financing option to ensure efficient utilization of these assets. Conversely, fixed assets are long-term in nature and are not easily converted into cash, making long-term debt suitable for their financing."
gemma:7b,4,39,Is the market risk premium a parameter for the national economy or for the world economy?,"**Verdict: For the world economy.**

The market risk premium is a parameter for the world economy because it is influenced by the covariance between the small country's market portfolio return and the return of the world market portfolio.","Verdict: For.

The market risk premium reflects the additional compensation investors demand for bearing risk in a specific market. It is influenced by factors specific to that market, such as economic conditions and political stability."
gemma:7b,4,40,The market risk premium is the difference between the historical return on the stock market and the return on bonds. But how many years does “historical” imply? Shall we use the arithmetic mean or the geometric one?,"**Verdict: Against**

Historical data can provide an estimate of the market risk premium, but it is important to consider the time period over which the data is collected. Using historical data that is too old may not be relevant for investors' expectations of the market risk premium today. The content suggests using the geometric mean of annual rates of return rather than the arithmetic mean.","**Verdict: Against**

The historical period used to calculate the market risk premium should be long enough to encompass various economic cycles and market conditions, but should also be recent enough to be relevant to the current investment environment. Neither the arithmetic mean nor the geometric one is ideal, as both have limitations in this context."
gemma:7b,4,41,"We are valuing a company, a lot smaller than ours, in order to buy it. As that company is a lot smaller than ours it will have no influence on the capital structure and on the risk of the resulting company. This is the reason why I believe that the beta and the capital structure which are relevant to the valuation of the company we are analyzing are the ones of our company. Am I right?","**Verdict: Against**

The context suggests that the beta of the larger company may not be appropriate for valuing the smaller company due to the potential for different risk profiles. The smaller company's capital structure and risk characteristics may differ significantly from the larger company, requiring a tailored beta estimate for accurate valuation.","Verdict: Against.

The capital structure and risk profile of a company can significantly impact its beta. Since the target company is significantly smaller than the acquirer, its capital structure and risk profile may differ materially from the acquirer's, requiring specific adjustments in the valuation process."
gemma:7b,4,42,"Our company (A) is going to buy another company (B). We want to value the shares of B and, therefore, we will use three alternatives of the structure Debt/Shareholders’ Equity so as to obtain the WACC: 1) present structure of A; 2) present structure of B, and 3) structure used by A to finance the acquisition of B’s shares. We will value the company B by applying these three alternatives and then take as a reference the average of the results. Is this correct?","**Verdict: For**

The use of multiple capital structures to calculate the WACC allows for a more comprehensive assessment of the target company's valuation. By considering different financing scenarios, the analyst can assess the impact of leverage and capital structure on the WACC and ultimately the value of the company.","Verdict: For

The use of multiple capital structures to value a target company is a widely accepted practice in corporate finance. By comparing the WACCs under different structures, the analyst can assess the impact of financing alternatives on the valuation of the target company."
gemma:7b,4,43,I think the Free Cash Flow (FCF) can be obtained from the Equity Cash Flow (CFac) by using the relation: FCF = CFac + Interests - ∆D. Is this true?,"**Verdict: Against**

The provided formula does not accurately represent the calculation of Free Cash Flow (FCF). FCF includes cash flows from operating activities after accounting for capital expenditures, changes in working capital, and debt repayments. The formula provided includes interests but omits the other components of FCF.","Verdict: Against.

The Free Cash Flow (FCF) is defined as the cash generated from operating activities minus capital expenditures. The relation provided involves adding Interests and subtracting ∆D, which is not the correct formula for calculating FCF."
gemma:7b,4,44,Is the relation between capitalization and book value of shares a good guide to investments?,"**Verdict: Against**

The provided text suggests that the relationship between capitalization and book value of shares is not a reliable guide for investments, as other factors such as market capitalization and stock performance should also be considered.","Verdict: Against

Capitalization is based on market value, while book value is based on historical cost. Market value may differ from historical cost due to factors such as accounting standards, inflation, and changes in business fundamentals. Therefore, the relation between capitalization and book value of shares is not a reliable guide to investments."
gemma:7b,4,45,Does it make any sense to form a portfolio comprised of companies with a higher return per dividend?,"**Verdict: For**

The provided text suggests that companies with higher dividend payouts are associated with lower required returns, implying that it makes sense to form a portfolio comprised of companies with a higher return per dividend.","**Verdict: Against**

Dividend return is just one of many factors to consider when constructing a portfolio. Focusing solely on higher dividend returns may lead to ignoring other important factors such as risk, volatility, and diversification."
gemma:7b,4,46,"A financial consultant is valuing the company I set as an objective (an entertainment centre) by discounting the cash flows until the end of the dealership at 7.26% (interest rate on 30-year-bonds = 5.1%; market premium = 5%, and Beta = 0.47%). 0.47 is a beta provided by Bloomberg for Kinepolis (the company whose activity is the management of several cinemas in the EU), in function of the Dax Index. Is it correct to use the beta of Kinepolis in this valuation?","**Verdict: Against**

The provided beta of 0.47 for Kinepolis, based on the Dax Index, is unlikely to be appropriate for valuing the entertainment centre due to the different industry and risk profiles between the two companies. The entertainment centre's beta should be estimated using comparable companies within the entertainment industry.","**Verdict: Against**

The beta of Kinepolis may not be appropriate for the entertainment centre being valued due to significant differences in industry, business models, and risk profiles between the two companies."
gemma:7b,4,47,"I have two valuations of the company we set as an objective. In one of them, the present value of tax shields (D Kd T) was calculated using Ku (required return to unlevered equity) and, in the other one, using Kd (required return to debt). The second valuation is a lot higher than the first one, but which of the two is better?","**Verdict: Against**

Using Kd to calculate the present value of tax shields is more appropriate for valuing the company as it considers the cost of debt, which is the actual cost incurred by the company to finance its investments.","**Verdict: Against**

Using Kd to calculate the present value of tax shields is inappropriate as it assumes that the tax shields are risk-free, which is not true."
gemma:7b,4,48,My investment bank told me that the beta provided by Bloomberg incorporates the illiquidity risk and the small cap premium because Bloomberg does the so-called Bloomberg adjustment formula. Is that true?,"**Verdict: Against**

The provided text does not contain any information regarding Bloomberg's adjustment formula incorporating illiquidity risk or the small cap premium. Therefore, the statement cannot be verified from the given context.","Verdict: Against.

The Bloomberg adjustment formula only corrects for the liquidity risk of the underlying assets, not for illiquidity risk or the small cap premium."
gemma:7b,4,49,"As my company is not listed, the investment banks apply an illiquidity premium. Actually, they say it is an illiquidity premium but then they call it a small cap premium. One of the banks, apparently based on Titman y Martin (2007), added the following small cap premiums: “0.91% if the capitalization is situated between $1,167 and $4,794 million; 1.70% if the capitalization is between $331 and $1,167 million; 4.01% if it is lower than $331 million”. Another bank adds 2% because historically the return of small companies was smaller than that of big companies. Which one is more appropriate?","**Verdict: Against**

The provided context does not contain any information regarding appropriate illiquidity premiums for unlisted companies. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which of the proposed premiums is more appropriate based on the given context.","**Verdict: Against**

The basis for the second bank's premium is not aligned with universally accepted principles of illiquidity premiums. The rationale of historical returns being lower for small companies is not relevant to the assessment of illiquidity."
gemma:7b,4,50,"An investment bank calculated my WACC. The report says: “the definition of the β β WACC is WACC = R + u (R - R ); R being the risk-free rate, u the unleveraged F M F F beta and R the market risk rate.” This is different from what we have seen in our M class. Are they right?","**Verdict: Against**

The provided definition of WACC differs from the standard formula where the cost of equity is calculated as the risk-free rate plus the market risk premium multiplied by the beta of the company's stock. The definition in the report includes an additional term, ""u"", which represents the unleveraged beta. This adjustment is not commonly used in the traditional WACC calculation.","Verdict: Against.

The formula provided deviates from the standard WACC formula that includes the cost of debt. The correct formula is WACC = (E/V) * Re + (D/V) * Rf * (1 - T) + β * (R - Rf), where E, D, and V represent the market values of equity, debt, and the firm respectively."
gemma:7b,4,51,"Did you see the Vueling case? How is it possible that an investment bank set the objective price of its shares in €2.50 per share on the 2nd of October of 2007, just after placing Vueling shares at €31 per share in June 2007?","Verdict: Against

The provided text does not contain any information regarding the Vueling case or the setting of its share price, so I am unable to answer this question from the given context.","Verdict: Against.

The significant difference between the share price at placement (€31) and the objective price (€2.50) suggests an error in setting the objective price."
gemma:7b,4,52,"I suppose that a valuation consciously realized in my name tells me how much I have to offer for the company, right?","**Verdict: Against**

The provided text suggests that startup valuations are often subjective and influenced by various factors, including growth potential, cash flow discounting, and market barriers. It implies that a valuation is an educated guess rather than an exact measurement of the true value of a company.","Verdict: Against.

Valuation is a market-driven process that reflects the value of a company based on its intrinsic and extrinsic factors. It does not necessarily reflect the amount a particular individual is willing or able to offer for the company."
